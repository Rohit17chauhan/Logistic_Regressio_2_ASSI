Accuracy:\\nWhat it tells you: Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model. It tells you what proportion of all predictions were correct, both for positive and negative cases.\\nWhen it’s useful: It works well when the classes are balanced, meaning there are roughly equal numbers of positive and negative cases in the dataset. However, in highly imbalanced datasets, accuracy can be misleading.\\n2. Precision:\\nWhat it tells you: Precision focuses on how many of the positive predictions were actually correct. It answers the question: When the model predicted something as positive, how often was it right?\\nWhen it’s useful: Precision is important when false positives (incorrectly predicting something positive when it's not) need to be minimized. For example, in fraud detection, you want high precision so that non-fraudulent transactions are not flagged as fraud.\\n3. Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate):\\nWhat it tells you: Recall measures how good the model is at identifying actual positive cases. It answers the question: Of all the actual positive cases, how many did the model find?\\nWhen it’s useful: Recall is important when false negatives (missing actual positive cases) are costly or dangerous. For example, in disease detection, recall is crucial because missing a positive diagnosis could have serious consequences.\\n4. F1-Score:\\nWhat it tells you: The F1-score is the balance between precision and recall.

This happens often in imbalanced datasets, where one class (like \"not spam\") is much more common than another (like \"spam\").\\n\\nExample: If a model predicts non-spam emails correctly most of the time but frequently misses spam emails (high False Negatives), it suggests the model is biased toward predicting non-spam.\\n\\n2.

Precision vs. Recall Trade-off:\\nThe confusion matrix can help highlight the trade-off between precision and recall.\\nIf precision is high but recall is low, the model may be biased toward making conservative positive predictions (only labeling something positive when it’s very confident), but it might miss many actual positives.\\nIf recall is high but precision is low, the model might be over-enthusiastic about predicting positives, leading to more False Positives.\\nExample: In a fraud detection system, high precision but low recall means the model is good at identifying fraud cases when it predicts fraud, but it may miss many actual fraud cases.\\n4. Sensitivity to Certain Classes:\\nIf one class has much better performance than another in the confusion matrix, it may indicate that the model is biased or performs better on one class than another.\\n\\nExample: If a sentiment analysis model predicts positive reviews accurately but struggles with negative reviews (high False Positives for negative reviews), it could suggest that the model is biased toward recognizing positive sentiment more easily than negative sentiment.\\n\\n5. Impact of Thresholds:\\nThe confusion matrix reflects the model’s predictions based on a certain decision threshold.
